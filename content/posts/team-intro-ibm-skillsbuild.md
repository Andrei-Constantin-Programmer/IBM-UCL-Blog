Welcome to the official blog for our UCL MSc project in collaboration with IBM!  
Over the coming weeks, we'll share progress updates, key learnings, and reflections as we build an AI-powered tool to help modernise legacy software systems.

## 1. Introduction
To effectively design and implement an AI-powered tool for refactoring legacy software, we knew we had to establish a shared understanding of key AI concepts, fast.

Instead of diving straight into building, our team took a structured approach: we enrolled in IBM SkillsBuild’s AI and Collaboration pathways. These courses gave us a practical introduction to current AI tools and practices, with a special focus on the capabilities of IBM watsonx and Granite models.

We approached this not as a checklist, but as a multi-pronged strategy. Each team member explored different AI courses to diversify our understanding and avoid redundancy.

## 2. AI Pathway
Each member selected different courses based on their existing expertise and interest. This ensured our combined knowledge was deeper and wider.

- Getting Started with Artificial Intelligence - A broad overview of AI's key concepts, terminology, and history.

- IBM Granite Models for Software Development - An in-depth look at IBM’s foundation models and their relevance to real-world developer workflows.

- Unleashing the Power of AI Agents - Explored how autonomous agents can extend LLMs' utility through goal-driven reasoning.

- Introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation - Introduced RAG as a solution to LLM hallucination and domain-specific augmentation.

- Vector Embeddings: AI’s Key to Meaning - Covered how embeddings allow semantic understanding and similarity search in AI systems.

- Use Generative AI for Software Development Using IBM watsonx - Hands-on introduction to watsonx tools applied to code generation and transformation.

- Introduction to Large Language Models - Established a grounding in how LLMs work under the hood, including architecture and limitations.

## 3. Collaboration Pathway
All members also completed:

Design Thinking – Learning to centre user needs, iterate quickly, and ideate without bias.

Agile Explorer – Refreshing agile values and practices for real-world software development.

These helped align our workflows and team dynamics - especially important as we begin working with collaborative tooling.
